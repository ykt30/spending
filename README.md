## 1. Introduction
### Problem statement	: 
Based on the available International Visitors spending in London dataset, will the international visitors spending in London increase or decrease in future (e.g., 2021)?
### Hypothesis		: 
The international visitors spending in London would see an increment in future, based on available historical data.
### Aim			: 
To give an overall evaluation of international visitors spending in London according to the origin country, transport mode and travel purpose.
### Objective		:
1.	To clean and pre-process the original dataset for better data efficiency.
2.	To predict the future tourism expenditure using Neural Network (NN) regression and time-series
3.	To evaluate and compare the model accuracies of NN regression and time-series.
4.	To explore and visualise the dataset with Python.

## 2. This work is separated into two categories:
1. Regression Neural Network: 
Regression Neural Network includes validation set and 5-fold-cross-validation to validate the model.
2. Time-series: 
Time-series utilises Prophet, a Python algorithm to forecast the spending in 2020 and 2021
